Greetings and salutations!

Thank you for joining debateGate. Through the participation of you and others like you,
we are going to be able to shift the dynamic of how we, as a society, perceive and
participate in our discourse online. debateGate is more than just another monetized
social media platform -- it's my attempt to modernize and improve the methods by which
we engage our peers in debate, even if we might fundamentally disagree with them. This
is a place where hatred, toxicity, fallacious reasoning, and trolling behavior have no
hold. It's a place where the people using the service have the power to change minds and
punish contemptible behaviour through the allmighty Vote.

This is a service where you, as an individual, can choose what issues you care about and
engage in nuanced discourse with an opponent. I've tried to distill debates into their
core essence, where claims and counterclaims are put forth and reasoned through. I hope
that this platform brings you as much joy and stimulating intellectual discussion as it
brought me when I made it.

Sebastian Benjamin, creator of debateGate
