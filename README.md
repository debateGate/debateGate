# Scaffolding
The base folder for debateGate that contains the config.py and other sensitive files

Config.py is a file that contains sensitive information, like email passwords and secret keys and the like. It's been scrubbed of this information, so that if you want to use it yourself when downloading debateGate you can. You have to provide an email address, the access keys for the Google API, and some other information to use it.

The requirements.txt is the single requirements.txt for the whole project, for use in generating the flask/ virtual environment.
